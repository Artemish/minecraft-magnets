## Minecraft magnet tilesheet generator

Assembles a collection of images into a grid ready to print into 1-inch square
tiles. Just edit the counts.json file and specify how many of each sub-image
you want in the output, and this script will generate printer-ready images
which you can cut out.

The output is pasted inside of a transparency outline which gives grid markers.
I calibrated it specifically with a test printer, and you'd need to do the same
if you want the final prints to have exactly one-inch square tiles.
